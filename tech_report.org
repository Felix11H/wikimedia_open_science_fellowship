* challenges & problems to solve

The following components are needed to ensure full reproducibility of a computational research study:

1. fully documented data and code
2. used software libraries
3. full computational environment

This raises the following questions:

1. 


* proposed solutions

Gr√ºning et al. (2017) makes the point of different levels of computational environment simulation.

1. virtual environment with cross-platform package manager (Conda)
2. software containers (Docker)
3. hardware virtualization



* examples & references
