** TODOs

*** collect resources and information for technical implementation of computational research study
- examples of studies who have used Docker/Singularity to publish their computational results?
- studies who have published using Sumatra or other electronic lab notebooks?

*** [November] write a short tech report outlining the challenges and proposed implementations in the study

Draft [[file:tech_report.org][tech_report.org]]

- collect and process feedback
